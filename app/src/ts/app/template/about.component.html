            <div class="description">
                <p>This is the third iteration of the Improv Database created by Shauvon McGill.</p>

                <p>Shauvon buit the first version of the database over a weekend in 2008, probably instead of an important school project of some sort. It was originally an experiment in dumb UI and Asynchronous data manipulation with Javascript, which was still pretty new at the time. It looked, and worked, really dumb.</p>

                <div class="image">
                    <img src="/images/history/version1.png" />
                    <p>Look at how dumb this was. It actually <a href="http://improv.denyconformity.com" target="_blank">still exists</a> if you want to give it a shot. The database currently doesn't exist, but I think the easter eggs and the crazy user interface should still work. Good luck!</p>
                </div>

                <p>Around 2010 Shauvon purchased the ImprovDatabase.com domain to host the project, but it mostly sat untouched for another five years.</p>

                <p>In early 2015, Shauvon began development of an entirely new app, built using modern technologies (and a usable interface). Around March of 2015, it was published online to the most minimal of fanfare.</p>

                <div class="image">
                    <img src="/images/history/version2.png" />
                    <p>A bit more usable!</p>
                </div>

                <p>Shauvon was not content, though. The interface was still a bit wonky and slow, and several features were just not as great as they could be. So, in late 2016, he sat down and completely rebuilt the thing <em>again</em>.</p>

                <div class="image">
                    <img src="/images/history/version3.png" />
                    <p>Here is Mark 3 as it first appeared in October, 2016. Not pictured: just how quickly and smoothly it loads.</p>
                </div>

                <p>The ImprovPlus app (nee The Improv Comedy Database) Mark IV is built with a pure Angular 2 front-end, connecting to a REST API written on NodeJS that interfaces with a PostgreSQL database. The application is hosted on Heroku. DNS and SSL services are provided by DNSimple. The SSL certificate currently ensuring your secure perusal of this page was provided by Comodo.</p>

                <p>What do you think? How does The ImprovPlus app treat you? Should we go back to a command line interface?</p>

                <h5>Version 1.0.2 - <em>Parton</em></h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Admins can now edit, create, and delete games, which means we can finally clean up some of the garbage in the Game Database (and add some entirely new garbage).</li>
                    <li>The login form is working really well. You can't log in, yet, but can you find all the Easter Eggs?</li>
                    <li>Fixed the - er, <em>a</em> - text overlap issue on mobile phones, so you can STOP WORRYING ABOUT IT.</li>
                    <li>Finally remembered about that background image.</li>
                    <li>Tweaked the "Send us your thoughts" button on the About page.</li>

                <h5>Version 1.0.1 - <em>Parton</em></h5>
                <p>I have done some of the groundwork necessary to get a user account system working. The ultimate result is I now have the ability to delete games (but nothing else, just yet). Still, groundwork is groundwork!</p>

                <h5>Version 1.0.0 - <em>Parton</em></h5>
                <p>Mark III of the Improv Comedy Database is armed and operational. We pretty much have feature parity with Mark II, except now it's so much better.</p>
