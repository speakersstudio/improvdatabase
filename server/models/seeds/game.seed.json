    "description": "<p>This game is played entirely using mime and gibberish.  Three players leave the room (or two players an an audience member).  One player remains on stage, and gets suggestions for a Location, an Occupation, and a Weapon (easily remembered as \"LOW\") which were involved in a murder.  Now the players each come inside one at a time, and (starting with the player on stage), convey to the next player what they think the three suggestions were. Take each thing one at a time, so everybody knows that you're trying to convey the Location first, then move on to the Occupation only when the guesser signifies that they have figured out the clue. This game works like the game \"telephone\" so the last player will hopefully be way off the mark.  When a player thinks he has all three things, everyone yells \"Murder Murder Murder!\" and he \"murders\" the first player.</p>\n\n<p>Once you've mastered the game, try a challenge mode, where each player only gets 30 seconds (or so) to convey each of the clues (Location, Occupation, Weapon). They move on, whether they get the clue or not.</p>",

The first player starts as the hero's butler or whatever, and begins delivering the eulogy. The butler introduced the hero's sidekick (played by the second player), and tells the audience her name, making it up on the spot. The sidekick should use the name she is given to inform her character. For example, if she is called the \"Human Parade\" she should start acting like a parade - whatever that means. Finally, she introduces the hero's nemesis, who has arrived at the funeral to pay respects (or perhaps get final revenge). The sidekick names the villain in the same way, coming up with a name on the spot. The three characters proceed to interact in some way, until they decide to leave or someone outside the scene edits it.",

    "description": "<p>This is a basic scene exercise, meant to distill a scene down to its most basic elements. This exercise is a good way to practice establishing the foundation of a scene. Three people, whom we will call Circle, Square, and Triangle, do a scene.  Circle starts, doing some sort of action on stage.  Square enters the scene and initiates as much as possible in a single sentence. Square should establish what Circle is doing, who they are, what their relationship is, and why they are doing what they are doing.  Circle counters by \"raising the stakes\" or building on what Square established. Finally, Triangle enters and solves the problem. You only have three lines, so it will be a very basic scene.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example:</p>\n\n<p><em>Circle slices bread.</em></p>\n\n<p>Square: \"Honey, that fresh bread smells so good, but I hate that you always take it all to work and never leave me any.\"</p>\n\n<p>Circle: \"When you are in charge of paying my salary, then I will be more inclined to bribe you with fresh bread.\"</p>\n\n<p>Triangle: \"I was just strolling through the neighborhood and I couldn't help but smell that delicious bread baking. I would gladly pay you for a loaf.\"</p>\n\n<p><em>Scene</em></p>\n\n<p>You can also play this with just two people, and have Square supply the resolution at the end.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In this scenic exercise, players explore the effects of status on character and relationships. Start with two or three players. If using three, consider tagging one of them to start the scene off-stage. Before the scene begins, each player should (secretly in their own heads) pick a number between one and the number of players. If two players pick the same number, that's fine. This number informs the player of their \"status\" in the scene. One is the lowest status, and two or three (or however many players there are) is the highest. Obviously, you can reverse that and make one the highest - just as long as everybody agrees as to what is \"high\" and what is \"low.\" With the numbers established (secretly, of course), the players then do a normal scene, with that number informing their character's status in the scene.</p>\n\n<p>This can be a challenging exercise, because it can prove difficult to drive a \"good\" scene and keep your status in mind. It can be helpful to pause the scene at some point and ask the audience (if this is during a practice or exercise) what they think each character's number is - this can help the players get an idea of how well they are conveying their status. You'll have more fun if you fully commit to your status. It can get really crazy (in a good way) if two players are \"competing\" over the same status, trying to outdo each other in being the lowest, highest, or most middlest status possible.</p>\n\n<p>Another technique you can use is to have each player draw a playing card and hold it to their forehead. This informs everybody else in the scene what everyone's status is, but each player doesn't know themselves. See how quickly and accurately you can figure out what your status is. If the old forehead thing is a little too silly, just draw a card and let it establish your status or your partner's status.</p>",

A caller sits nearby and can rotate the square by calling \"left\" and \"right\" thereby making a different pair of players the ones in front. Go through a full rotation of the square, getting a suggestion from the audience for each pair (there should be four). Now begin a scene with the front pair. At any point the caller can rotate the square, and whichever pair of players is in front plays their scene. Each player is therefore in two different scenes. When a particular scene returns to the front, it can either continue right where they left off, or from some point in the future.

    "description": "A player starts a solo scene, or two players can start a scene together. At some point, usually after doing some sort of action, someone offstage can ring a bell or clap their hands. When this happens (the ring or the clap), the player has to commit to performing the action they were doing in the absolute most serious, exciting, or interesting way possible. Even if it's something as simple as walking across the stage, they have to walk the house down. This single, specific action continues, without changing to anything else (in other words, if the action is picking something off a shelf, that's the action - you can't go to holding the object or using it). Someone offstage can then  clap or ring that bell again and the scene can continue. Use this to see just how crazy you can make a single, simple action.",

When the outside group returns, the inside group will explain that they came up with a great story, which the outside group will have to guess by only asking 'yes or no' questions. The inside group didn't come up with any story, of course, and will simply answer 'yes' or 'no' based on some random criteria which they will establish. For example, respond 'yes' to any question that starts with a vowel, or any question with the verb \"go\" in it, or always say 'yes' after you have said 'no' twice in a row. The outside group returns and everybody splits up so one outsider is paired with one insider, and they come up with a story together. The idea is that this will prove how easy it is to invent a story on the spot, because the person asking the questions is coming up with everything right there.

Now starting with somebody, the players pass a \"fish\" around from one player to the player next to them. When you get the \"fish\" you can do one of two things. Saying \"Big Fish\" while holding your hands in front of you a few inches apart will pass the \"fish\" to the next player. Saying \"Small Fish\" while holding your hands in front of you 20 or so inches apart will change the direction of the fish, and send it back the way it came. Remember, for \"Big Fish\" you show a small gap between your hands, and for \"Small Fish\" you show a large one. Go figure. You can play it with elimination by removing the players that mix up the direction or the size of the fish.",

    "description": "Circle up, circle down, circle over, circle in any preposition you want, as long as it means \"gather everybody into a circle.\" Pick somebody to go first, and he will form a \"bunny\" with the player on either side of him. To form the bunny, the player in the middle holds his hands to his chest (you know, like a bunny would), and the players on either side holds their hands up in the shape of big rabbit ears on either side of his head. Alternatively, the three players can just each be a bunny all on their own - I don't care. The point is that three players all start saying \"bunny\" and hopping up and down really fast. The goal is to be as ridiculously manic and crazy as possible. The players keep doing it until the middle player throws the mystical bunny energy to someone across the circle. When the energy is passed to you (or somebody next to you), you had better bunny up.",

    "description": "<p>Get all up in a circle. Someone starts by pointing at another player in the circle and loudly stating, \"you.\" That person then says \"yes\" and points to another player to say, \"you\" again. Here's the catch: when you point to someone and they say \"yes,\" you start walking to them to take their spot. Don't hesitate, and don't wait for them to point to someone else. When you hear \"yes\" you move. Feel free to take your time to make sure they have time to point to someone else, but that shouldn't be too hard. This game should become a cool ballet of people switching around the circle once you get the pattern down and people get over the panic that inevitably sets in when someone starts walking toward you.",

Get a suggestion to prompt the group, and one player starts with a simple word or phrase inspired by the suggestion. Players then take turns adding their own words or phrases, inspired by the previous word or phrase. Each new building block is simply adding to the items that came before, continuing the theme. Let go of your desire to show off your hilarious wit or jokes - those things do not add to the pattern that the group is creating. As you progress through the phrases, a pattern will develop with the connections, and the group should play into that.

The other pairs pretend to continue their conversations, but they stay silent, listening to the conversation with focus.

    "description": "This is a simple word association warmup. All of the players get in a circle, and one player starts by saying a word out loud. The next player says the fist thing that pops into her head, and so on around the circle. Don't try to make a joke or reference to something - just say the first word that comes to mind when you hear what the person directly before you says. Go around the circle a few times, so each player says a few different things, and then repeat the entire pattern again. When you repeat, everyone should say exactly what they said before (all of the things in the same order). If you made sure to say the first word that comes to mind each time, it will be super easy to do the exact same pattern again.",

    "description": "Often called \"3 Things\" or \"5 Things,\" this game works with a simple premise.  One member leaves the performance area, and two more members get suggestions for simple activities.  Common, easy to guess items in the activities are replaced by more suggestions, resulting in bizarre activities that the first member is then required to guess.  The activities must be explained to the first member using mime and gibberish only.  Activity suggestions include \"skydiving with an elephant as a parachute.\"  The main variation is the number of activities taken (usually 3 or 5).",

    "description": "The scene starts with two players, or three if that's your pleasure.  Everybody has someone else off-stage who is their double.  Somebody off-stage yells \"switch\" at various times during the scene, which causes everyone to switch with their double.  Players on stage switch with their doubles off stage (or on stage, if their double is on stage as well), and so on.  Everyone is allowed to walk into the scene, so by the end, everybody is on stage.  All of the players will have two characters in the scene (one that they created and one that their double created).  As more players are on stage, the caller calls \"switch\" more often, causing what looks like partially organized chaos.  By the end, the players switch roles every few words.  This seems like a very complicated game, but it is much simpler to play than it looks, making it a very entertaining experience for audiences.",

Two more players sit off-stage, providing the English language \"dubbing\" to the foreign language spoken lines. Yes, the foreign languages are just gibberish, but try not to be too offensive about it. Start this game with a suggestion for a foreign language and the title of the movie. I like to combine book and movie titles, or just get an activity, and call the movie that.",

The confronted player responds with \"ZEY ARE IN MY ATACHÃƒÂ©.\" Meanwhile, as the \"it\" player is distracted with this daunting task, players behind his back should be making eye contact with other players in the circle. When eye contact is made, the two players should immediately switch places with each other. If the \"it\" player notices this happening and steals one of the moving players' positions, the player stuck in the middle is now \"it.\"",

    "description": "Each player takes turns telling a small part of a story, the title of which is given by the audience. The trick is that a player doesn't have to tell the chronologically next piece of the story on each turn. On his or her turn, a player stands somewhere along a line across the stage, generally indicating the position of their part of the story. When each player steps forward, the players already in place tell the entire story so the new player can include his or her piece in order. As each player comes out, the story slowly starts to come together and (hopefully) makes more sense. When a player stands between two others, their piece should theoretically or to some extent connect the adjacent parts together.",

The zanier (and less like an actual illness) the better. Then the patient returns and the doctor leaves. The patient gets the cure for the illness and what side-effects it has (hopefully without the audience giving away the illness). The doctor returns, and they conduct a doctor-patient scene (which is apropos since they're a doctor and a patient). The patient first tries to guess their illness and how they got it. Then the doctor has to guess how it's cured and what the side-effects are. For added excitement, time each player and announce how long it took them after they succeed so we can see who is the better guesser or whatever.",

    "description": "This game is played like a goofy infomercial, with a cheesy host introducing each player. The players enter one at a time as inventors to show off their amazing new inventions. Before the game starts, the host gets a handful of nouns, verbs, and international locations. The host then uses those suggestions to introduce the three inventors as being from [LOCATION], and having invented the [NOUN] [VERB]er. For example, if some suggestions were \"Plastic,\" \"Wipe,\" and \"Austrailia,\" the host would say \"our next guest is from Australia, and he invented the 'Plastic Wiper!'\" The inventor then takes a few minutes to talk to the host about themselves and demonstrate their invention and what it does (don't forget to tell everybody where they can buy it and how much it costs!). The host then says goodbye to the inventor and rouses the audience to all say along with him, \"WHAT WILL THEY THINK OF NEXT?!\"",

    "description": "Two players stand at the front of the stage as \"presenters\" (it can be just one player I guess if you're strapped for people). The presenters introduce themselves (as zany characters) and prepare the audience for a slideshow of photos from their recent vacation. The presenters' vacation destination and a famous person they met on their trip are taken as suggestions from the audience. Now the presenters show their slides, which are presented by the rest of the group forming a tableau on stage. The presenters proceed to narrate what is happening in each picture. The presenters should remember to tell the story of how they met the given celebrity. It helps to have control of lighting so the presenters can turn the lights off and on to signify the changing of  the slides.",

That activity is now the cut-throat sport being played in this high-stakes match. Two players act as commentators (to be true to sporting events, one commentator should be a play-by-play announcer and the other should provide color commentary). Another two players are the athletes, competing in a world championship of whatever mundane activity you got. The athletes should operate entirely in slow motion, being careful to match their speeds by shaking hands to start the match. As the match goes on, the mundane, \"boring\" activity will become much more \"full contact\" and violent, until basically one of the competitors is physically unable to finish the match, or one of the players is disqualified for doing some ridiculous thing. Feel free to have a ref enter at some point (also in slow motion) to manage things. Also feel free (as the commentators) to pause the action, show replays, zoom in, or otherwise call the shots. ",

Now go around the circle and introduce yourself. You have two options, which are as follows: say your name and a word that rhymes with your name (\"Karin Starin'\"), or say a word that alliterates with your name (\"Calamity Karen\"). You can also throw a gesture in there too, knock yourself out. Each consecutive person around the circle then repeats the name, alliteration / rhyme, and action of everybody who was before them, and adds their name and whatever to the end. Yes, the last poor sap in the circle has to do everybody.",

    "description": "Three players start a scene in a car, sitting in four chairs arranged like the front and back seats. Soon a fourth player enters as a hitchhiker, and the car pulls over to pick them up. The hitchhiker takes on a wild and crazy character trait which the other people in the car should adapt and heighten. After all four players have fully embraced this character trait and had some fun with it, the driver of the car leaves and everybody moves up one seat (the passenger becomes the driver, the guy in the back seat moves to the front, and the hitchhiker moves over). Another player then arrives as another hitchhiker, with a different character trait, and the process is repeated. This process continues until everybody has had a chance to come up with a character (the initial three people in the car should go to the back of the line - they will be the last three players to come up with a character).",

    "description": "First, everybody should get all up in a circle. Now somebody turns to their left and faces that person. The first person then does some sort of action (preferrably with a sound effect). The second person then turns to the next and PERFECTLY repeats the action and sound. The second person likewise turns to the next and EXACTLY replicates the action they just saw. The goal here is to try to be as exact and precise (and other synonyms) as possible, so each time the action is done it is exactly the same. Obviously, however, that won't be the case, as everybody adds their own oddities (either intentionally or unintentionally) to the mix. Just focus on repeating the action you just saw, dis-ir-regardless of what has come before. By the end, the action will have mutated into something beautiful.",

    "description": "<p>Start by gathering everyone in a big circle. Now, hand someone an imaginary \"red ball\" with a specific size, weight, or other physical properties that you can easily distinguish. Hand someone else an imaginary \"yellow ball\" with a different set of properties. Finally, hand someone an imaginary \"green ball\" with still different properties. For example, the red ball could be like a volley ball, the yellow ball could be like a big inflatable beach ball, and the green ball could be like one of those super balls you get out of a gumball machine at the supermarket and then have your RA confiscate from you (or was that just me?). Once you establish your balls, you may begin.</p>\n\n<p>Play happens as follows: when you have a \"ball\" you should hand (or toss) the ball to someone else in the circle (this is all done using the powers of IMAGINATION). Make eye contact and clearly tell them \"red ball\" (or whatever ball you are handing them) and they will respond with \"red ball, thank you\" (or, again, whatever type of ball you are handing them). They then pass the ball to someone else.</p>\n\n<p>The point is to listen and pay attention so you know what ball you have, and to make sure the person you are handing the ball is aware that you are handing them a ball (and what ball you are handing them). For bonus points (and trust me, I am keeping track of those bonus points) throw a few more balls in during play, just to make things even more crazy.</p>\n\n<p>For the record, you can make the balls whatever you want. Want a bowling ball in there? How about a paintball? I don't care, dude.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This is really a whole genre of game. In this, the group stands in a circle and passes energy around from one player to the next. The nature of the passing really depends on you, as long as all of the players are on the same page. This description will outline the basic idea with some made up sounds that you can feel free to use or replace with whatever sounds you want. This description doesn't care.</p>\n\n<p>The basic way to pass the energy is directly to the next person in the circle by waving your arms and saying \"whoosh.\" The energy is thereby for the most part passed in one direction around the circle from one player to the next. Easy Peasy.</p>\n\n<p>Except! At any time a player can hold up a hand to the energy and say \"switch!\" When this happens, the direction is reversed, and it goes back the other way. The person who was \"switch'd\" can then \"whoosh\" on back the other direction. You can also \"switch\" a \"switch\" if you are that kind of person.</p>\n\n<p>Also! You can point to a person across the circle and say \"zoom\" at them. Now the energy is passed to them. They can then \"whoosh\" in the same direction it was heading before (unless that's too complicated for you, in which case just whoosh whichever way). I don't think it makes sense to \"switch\" a \"zoom\" so just don't do that. You can \"zoom\" a \"switch,\" though, but you can't tune a fish - er...</p>\n\n<p>Concordantly! You can also say \"pow\" in the direction of the energy flow, moving your arms over the head of the person next to you as if you were throwing a classic hook shot from such basketballs. When you do this, the energy skips the next person and goes to the person after that. It then continues on like normal. If a person gets \"pow'd\" they can \"switch\" which would send it to the person who was skipped, if that makes any sense at all.</p>\n\n<p>And lo! Feel free to add any manor of other things, giving them a distinct sound and gesture. You can make a thing send the energy behind you, so you face one person but the energy goes the opposite direction. You can make a thing that makes everybody in the circle do and / or say something. Go crazy!</p>\n\n<p>The idea is to just get into a pattern, getting used to making quick decisions within a set structure and being okay with screwing up (because there are no consequences). Feel free to start with one or just a couple things and work your way up as the players get used to them.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Everybody gets in a big old circle. Starting somewhere, a player points to another player and says basically any word. That person (the person who just got pointed at) points at somebody else and says another word, hopefully following in some sort of pattern to what was said first. This continues until everybody has been pointed at and everybody has a word. As an example, if the first person said, \"bologna,\" the following words could be \"ham,\" \"roast beef,\" or \"turkey,\" thereby following the pattern, \"types of deli meats.\" Anyway, go over your pattern a few times, making sure everybody remembers their word, and the word preceding them.</p>\n\n<p>Now things get interesting. Let the first pattern go (for now), and do another one. Take turns pointing and saying a thing (pick a different thing and a different person to point at this time), creating a new pattern. After you go over the second pattern a couple times, and while the second pattern is still going, start the first pattern again. See how long and how fast you can keep both patterns going at the same time without either dropping one or randomly having two of the same pattern at once (it happens).</p>\n\n<p>Once you get the hang of two, start a third!</p>\n\n<p>It can be good to start with everybody's name for the first pattern, so as to serve as a sort of icebreaker for everybody.</p>\n\n<p>Another option is to just say \"you\" for the pattern, eliminating any need to come up with words or remember names. Just focus on the pattern. You can get really intense with it, too, and keep doing the pattern until everybody can do it with their eyes closed.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Everybody stands in a circle, with one player in the middle. This player in the middle, we'll call them \"It,\" randomly steps up to players in the circle and throws challenges at them (we'll call the challenged player \"At\"). Any time a player slips up and does something they aren't supposed to, \"It\" takes their place, and they become the new \"It.\"</p>\n\n<p>The first challenge is for \"It\" to simply yell <strong>\"Bibbity Bibbity Bop!\"</strong> When this happens, the goal is for \"At\" to say \"Bop\" before \"It\" does.</p>\n\n<p>With that mastered, increase the challenge by adding <strong>\"Miggity Miggity Mack.\"</strong> When \"It\" says this, the goal is for \"At\" to say nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Once you get the hang of all that, you can throw in the fun ones. For these, \"It\" will yell a word at \"At\" and then count to 10 as quickly as possible. Before \"It\" reaches ten, \"At\" and the player on each side of \"At\" have to build whatever thing \"It\" yelled. Agree on the words and forms that you will use ahead of time. There's no limit to what things you can use, so you can mix it up to keep people on their toes. There are some old standards which you can use or take inspiration from.</p>\n\n<p>The first is <strong>\"Elephant.\"</strong> When \"Elephant\" is called, \"At\" forms a trunk by holding one hand on their nose and sticking their other arm out in front (making an elephant noise is highly encouraged). The player to the left of \"At\" forms the left ear by holding her arms up to \"At's\" head (like you're three-fourths of the way through the YMCA song). The player on the right of \"At\" forms the right ear in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>For <strong>\"Toaster\"</strong> the two players on either side of \"At\" hold their arms together, forming a \"slot\" for \"At\" to pop out of like a piece of toast. I don't know what kind of sound toast makes, but feel free to figure that out.</p>\n\n<p>Another fun one would be <strong>\"Flamingos.\"</strong> For this one, the three players (\"At\" and the player on either side of her) all pretend to be a flock of flamingoes. This is pretty simple, you just hold your hands under your arms (as if you felt like chicken tonight) and stand with one foot on your other knee (this is a thing flamingoes do a lot, because they don't have anything better to do).</p>\n\n<p>Yet another option is <strong>\"Star Wars.\"</strong> For this the three players will form the classic image on the original Star Wars poster. \"At\" becomes Luke, and holds his \"copyright non-infringing generic laser sword\" up in the air over his head. The player on the right becomes Han, and stands with his back to \"At\" holding a \"unspecified handheld shoot blaster\" at the ready. Finally, the player on the left becomes Leia, and kneels at Luke's feet in that awkward, subservient sort of pose that we never talk about. As a reminder, remember that <em>Left</em> is <em>Leia</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Use any combination of these things, or come up with your own challenges. Start with just one or two options, and add more as you master them. The point is to keep people on their feet, reacting quickly, and working together. Have fun!</p>",

    "description": "<p>This is probably the most classic Improv warmup exercise. First, everybody gets in a circle, facing inside. Someone starts, and passes energy randomly across the circle, with the pattern \"Zip, Zap, Zup\" saying the words one at a time. The first player passes \"Zip\" across the circle to someone, then that person passes \"Zap\" to someone else, and then that player passes \"Zup\" to someone, who starts the pattern all over again.</p>\n\n<p>Make eye contact, and be clear and direct when you pass the energy. Make sure there can be no confusion about what your intentions are. Point your finger and enunciate loudly and clearly. If you aren't clear about who you are passing to, or what syllable you have passed, it could lead to confusion about what happens next. Every player in this game is a link in a chain - don't be the link that breaks the chain.</p>\n\n<p>You can do whatever you want when someone messes up (either by missing the pattern, saying the wrong word, taking too long, or thinking they have the pattern when they don't). Most people simply eliminate everyone until only two people are left. This isn't very fun, though, because nobody likes to feel like they failed a warmup exercise. An alternative is to make the people who have little accidents switch to a different pattern. For example, while everybody stays on \"Zip Zap Zup\" the person who missed their turn will be on \"Kip, Kap, Kup\" instead, so the pattern might go, \"Zip, Kap, Zup, Zip, Zap, Kup\" and so-on. If they mess up \"Kip Kap Kup,\" they can switch to \"Tip, Tap, Tup,\" or \"Wip, Wap, Wup,\" or whatever else you want.</p>\n\n<p>Start the pattern slowly enough for everybody to get into it. Let the players, especially if they've never played before, get used to the pattern and with passing energy across the circle. As you get more into it, increase the speed and intensity. See how quickly and smoothly you can fire off the pattern. Missing the pattern doesn't mean you failed, it just means you get to have a new way to play.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Gather the group into a circle. One at a time, starting anywhere in the circle and continuing clockwise, each player will introduce themselves by saying their name (first names are fine) and doing a gesture of some sort. The gesture doesn't have to be anything specific or make any sense. You could do a jumping jack, salute, or abstractly wave your arms about - it doesn't matter. The point is to just get on your feet and do a thing. After each player demonstrates their name and gesture, the entire group repeats it in unison. Try your best to replicate the gesture as closely as the person who created it.</p>\n\n<p>After everyone has had a chance to give their gesture, inform the group that you are going to raise the stakes. Consider your level of commitment and enthusiasm a \"1\" and go through the process again, raising it to a \"10.\" Starting with the first player again and repeat the process with the same names and gestures. Each player demonstrates their name and gesture, this time increasing the intensity all the way to 10. The group repeats it in unison, copying that level of intensity. What does it feel like to commit more fully to an action? How does your gesture evolve? Does it go from a simple hop to a giant leap? Does a simple salute become a full-body exercise?</p>\n\n<p>After doing all of the gestures again, repeat the process a third time. Consider this new level of commitment a \"1\" and extrapolate that all the way to \"10.\" How can you make your gesture that much more intense?</p>\n\n<p>Now endeavor to do everything with that level of commitment and enthusiasm. Why not just start at maximum intensity?</p>\n\n<p><em>You can apply two modifications to this game. First, instead of having the entire group repeat each gesture in unison, have each player repeat all of the names and gestures of every player that came before them. Yes, this means that the last player in the circle will be doing everybody's gesture. Also, instead of just doing one gesture, you can have each player do a different gesture for each syllable in their name. For example, if my name was \"Alyson,\" I would do a gesture for \"al,\" a gesture for \"ih,\" and a gesture for \"son.\"</em></p>",

    "description": "<p>First, get some sort of crisis from the audience (we ran out of somebody's favorite food, maybe), and some sort of object (anything, really). A player then starts a scene in which they are confronted by the given crisis. To save the day, the starting player decides to call upon the help of [suggestion] man (or woman). The second player enters the scene as [suggestion] man (so if the suggestion was \"coffee cup\" the player is \"Coffee Cup Woman\" or something). Using the powers customary to someone with the given name, the player attempts to solve the crisis only to make things worse. This means they need to call in their colleague (perhaps \"doorknob man\" or \"The Human Tire\"), who gets an equally absurd name (that the first \"hero\" makes up on the spot).</p>\n\n<p>This continues through two more heroes (for a total of three, plus the non-hero who starts the scene). Finally the last hero manages to solve the problem, or to make things more fun (in my opinion) the non-hero who started the scene can solve it somehow. With the problem solved, the heroes can leave with as much bluster as they arrived.</p>\n\n<p>There are two things to consider in this game. The first is the idea that you are \"pimping\" these super heroes with crazy names that they have to live up to. You can have each hero named by random audience suggestions if you must. The second thing to play with is the concept of status. As a hero, you might enter with the highest of high status, but when you fail to solve the problem (or more likely make it much worse) you will fall to the lowest of the low. These are the things that funny situations are made of.</p>",

    "description": "This exercise allows players to practice a technique for developing scenes and environments. Two players perform a normal scene, but every time either player delivers a line, they have to establish something new about their environment. For example, you might reach into a cabinet to pick something up, open up some curtains, or turn on a lamp. The actions should be physical, not verbal (actually do the thing, don't just mention something), and they do not need to be related to what you are talking about. See how clearly and effectively you can establish your environment.",
